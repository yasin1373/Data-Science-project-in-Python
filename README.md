This project conducts exploratory data analysis and cleaning on a healthcare dataset. Key steps:

Data inspection: shape, null values, distributions
Imputing missing data
Encoding categorical features
Outlier detection and removal
Scaling numerical features
Basic feature engineering and transformations
Some sample supervised learning tasks are shown like feature importance analysis and linear regression.

The cleaned dataframe is prepared for further machine learning modeling and evaluation.

The code demonstrates Python data science best practices using Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-learn, and Statsmodels. It can serve as a template for healthcare data preparation and analysis projects.
